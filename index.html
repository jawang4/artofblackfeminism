		<p><h6>
			Black feminism originated from the agency of addressing intersectional challenges specifically faced by Black women. Distinctly separate from mainstream “White” feminism, Black Feminism utilizes identity politics to tackle the issues that comes directly from working out of their own identity as opposed to challenging oppression of a specific group.</h6>
			<h6>
			As explained in the Combahee River Collective Statement, “if Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all systems of oppression.” Black women have faced misrepresentation in their community and White-dominated institutions while being subjected to racial, sexist, and classist discrimination through harmful stereotypes. These stereotypes perpetuate the image of a “Strong Black woman”— whether that is the mammy, jezebel, sapphire, or the “matriarch”—further devaluing their lives and needs. 
			</h6>
			<span class="quote">"Merely naming the pejorative stereotypes attributed to Black women, [...] let alone cataloguing the cruel , often murderous, treatment we receive, in dicates how little value has been placed upon our lives during four centuries of bondage in the Western hemisphere. We realize that the only people who care enough about us to work consistently for our liberation is us."<br><a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2019/01/01/a-black-feminist-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- Combahee River Collective</a>
			</span>
			
			<h6>
			By combining both literary and visual pieces from the late 19th century to present day, Art of Black Feminism specifically examines the experiences of the Black women artists whom engaged with activism and politics through an artistic perspective as a means to challenge preconceived notions of their identity.
			Focusing on the artistic practices of artists in the 20th century and present day, this digital collection aims to spark more discussion for the following questions:
		</h6><span class="question">
			What does contemporary representation of Black women in art look like? Who is part of that representation, and what kinds of conversations about feminism and inequalities do they have in their works? How can art institutions better represent Black voices?

				<br><span class="quote2">Black women's everyday behavior itself is a form of activism. People who view themselves as fully human, as subjects [versus Objects], become activists, no matter how limited the sphere of the activism may be.</span><br><br><span class="quote3">—Patricia Hill Collins</span><br><br>

				<span class="bodyText">Throughout the waves of Black feminism, Black women have utilized their everyday life as a catalyst for their body of work. In their efforts to advocate against the oppression of all peoples, Black artists also tackle the challenges that comes with redefining how Black voices are to be represented in fine arts spaces. One of the first major exhibitions that attempted to bring Black representation was <span class="bodyText2">Harlem in My Mind: Cultural Capital of Black America: 1900-68</span> exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1969.
				<br><br> Instead of featuring the work of artists within the Harlem community, the exhibiton only cotained photographs and oversized photo murals that did not show show the artistry of individuals that lived in Harlem. Many people in the community including the members of the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC) argued that “If art represents the very soul of a people, then this rejection of the Black painter and sculptor is the most insidious segregation of all”. This would not be the only time  Black artists had spoken up against museums for their curation.  
				
				<br><br>The Whitney Biennial—an exhibition held every two years at the Whitney Museum since 1973 (previously Whitney Annual held every year)—has had multiple instances where artists have protested against disproportionate demographic of predominately white and men artists. In 1970, Faith Ringgold among other artists in the Ad Hoc Women's Art Committee protested and sent letters to the Museum demanding half of the artists to be women and 50% of women be black. The Sculpture Annual that year would only feature 20 women out of a hundred artists in response.

				<br><span class="bodyText">The sections below details few of the many artists that enagaged with Black feminist thought in their own work to challenge the narratives of what diversity and Black artistry looks like in institutions.

					<h3>Emma Amos</h3><br><br>

					<span class="museum">Emma Amos, Sandy and her Husband, 1973. Collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art.
					</span>

					<br>
					<span class="quote4">"It's always been my contention that for me, a black woman artist, to walk into the studio is a political act."</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class="bodyText"><span class="nameText">Emma Amos</span> (1937-2020) was the only woman and youngest member of the Spiral collective, a group of young Black artists formed in 1963 that worked to address social issues together and in their work. 
					<br><br>
					Although Spiral was an important collective at the time, Amos found that their discussion around Black representation in the art world did not include the nuances that came with race and gender. She would later also become members of feminist collectives Heresies and Guerillla Girls. 
					<br><br>
					Both her printmaking and figurative paintings reflected the experiences of Black women and often incorporated symbolism and vivid colors. In one particular painting, Sandy and her Husband (1973), she depicts herself through another painting unseen by a couple dancing to symbolically depict the distance she felt from the rest of the art world. </span>

					<h3>Faith Ringgold</h3>
			
					<span class="bodyText"><span class="nameText">Faith Ringgold</span> (b. 1930) internationally renowned began her art career in the 1960s. As a painter, sculpture, and writer, she developed her own visual language through painted "story quilts". These story quilts use traditions of quilting and storytelling to illustrate scenes influenced by her experiences. 
					<br><br>
					<span class="quote4">"I became a feminist because I wanted to help my daughters, other women and myself aspire to something more than a place behind a good man."</span>
					<br><br>
					Her first quilt <span class="bodyText2">Who's Afraid of Aunt Jemima</span> flips the Mammy stereotype placed on the brand character that shares the same name as the woman in the quilt narrative. Made during the time she was struggling to get her own autobiography published, Ringgold rewrites Jemima's story into one of an entrepreneur in this particular quilt.

					</span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="bodyText"><span class="nameText">Mildred Howard</span> (b.1945) primarily works in sculpture and assemblages recontextualizing found everyday objects and places in the San Francisco Bay Area as a means to respond to political and societal issues such as gentrification, consciousness, and equality.<br><br>
						<span class="quote4">
						“But hopefully there's something in my work that will trigger [a] person to see the world in a whole different way, and as a result of that, it may help the viewer to search a little bit more about the meaning of things and not just accept things the way they are.”</span>
						<br><br>
						The concept of intersectionality and studying how multiple aspects of identity creates systems of oppression is reflected in much of her work, including <span class="bodyText2">Thirty Eight Double Dee</span>, where Howard juxtaposed a white floral bra with a box of fragile eggs to visually explain the complex relationship between feminity of motherhood and the sexualization of Black womens' bodies.

					<br>
					<span class="quote4">"I always knew that when it came to portraying women, I wanted to do more than just a pretty portrait. I didn't want a woman holding children because everybody does that."</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class="bodyText">As a member of the Weusi Artist Collective and the Where We At Collective along with Faith Ringgold in the 1960s, <span class="nameText">Dindga McCannon</span> (b. 1947) contexulizes historical memory and focuses specifically on Black women in her mixed media work.
					<br><br>
					Utilizing the needling skills taught by her mother and grandmother, she combines fibers with drawing, painting, as well as printmaking mediums to experiment a variety of multi-layered processes. More recently her work "Harlem Women's Series" combines portraiture with textured luminous backgrounds.
