			Black feminism originated from the agency of addressing intersectional challenges specifically faced by Black women. Distinctly separate from mainstream “White” feminism, Black Feminism utilizes identity politics to tackle the issues that comes directly from working out of their own identity as opposed to challenging oppression of a specific group.</h6>
			<h6>
			As explained in the Combahee River Collective Statement, “if Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all systems of oppression.” Black women have faced misrepresentation in their community and White-dominated institutions while being subjected to racial, sexist, and classist discrimination through harmful stereotypes. These stereotypes perpetuate the image of a “Strong Black woman”— whether that is the mammy, jezebel, sapphire, or the “matriarch”—further devaluing their lives and needs. 
			</h6>
			<span class="quote"><h6>"Merely naming the pejorative stereotypes attributed to Black women, [...] let alone cataloguing the cruel , often murderous, treatment we receive, in dicates how little value has been placed upon our lives during four centuries of bondage in the Western hemisphere. We realize that the only people who care enough about us to work consistently for our liberation is us."<br><a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2019/01/01/a-black-feminist-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- Combahee River Collective</a>

			By combining both literary and visual pieces from the late 19th century to present day, Art of Black Feminism specifically examines the experiences of the Black women artists whom engaged with activism and politics through an artistic perspective as a means to challenge preconceived notions of their identity.
			Focusing on the artistic practices of artists in the 20th century and present day, this digital collection aims to spark more discussion for the following questions:
		</h6><h3>
			What does contemporary representation of Black women in art look like? Who is part of that representation, and what kinds of conversations about feminism and inequalities do they have in their works? How can art institutions better represent Black voices?

					<h3>Emma Amos<br><br><span class="quote4">It's always been my contention that for me, a black woman artist, to walk into the studio is a political act.</span></h3>

					<h6>Emma Amos (1937-2020) was the only woman and youngest member of the Spiral collective, a group of young Black artists formed in 1963 that worked to address social issues together and in their work. Although Spiral was an important collective at the time, Amos found that the discussion around Black representation in the art world did not include the nuances that came with race and gender. She would later also become members of feminist collectives Heresies and Guerillla Girls. Both her printmaking and figurative paintings reflected the experiences of Black women and often incorporated symbolism and vivid colors. </h6>
